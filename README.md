# Welcome to Taco *Tandem*onium!
Guac is *not* extra, cause it's on me ðŸ˜‰

I am using a ReactJS as my framework of choice with JavaScript for this application as this is, currently, at the forefront of my mind.  I am also choosing to persist the data to local storage.  For something simple like taco recipes, I think this would be pretty efficient because my assumption is that we will not be dealing with millions of records.
