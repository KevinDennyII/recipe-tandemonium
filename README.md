# Welcome to Taco *Tandem*onium!

I am using a ReactJS as my framework of choice with JavaScript for this application as this is, currently, at the forefront of my mind.  I am also choosing to persist the data to local storage.  For something simple like taco recipes, I think this would be pretty efficient because my assumption is that we will not be dealing with millions of records.

## Notes for later
My assumptions for dietary restrictions:  
	* Dairy-free
	* Halal  
	* Vegan  
	* Vegetarian  
	* Nut-free  
	* Gluten-free
